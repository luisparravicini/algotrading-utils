This repo was created in order to contain what I'm coding to learn how to do backtesting with three different libraries:

- [pyalgotrade](https://github.com/gbeced/pyalgotrade)
- [zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline)
- [backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader)

As of 2020-12-26, *pyalgotrade* looks dead (last commit in 2018), the other two look active.

The investing strategy is always the same, just a [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052013/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp).

Each implementation is inside the directories with the same name as the library used:

- [pyalgotrade implementation](pyalgotrade/README.md)
- [zipline implementation](zipline/README.md)
- [backtrader implementation](backtrader/README.md)
