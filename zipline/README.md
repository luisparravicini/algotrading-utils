# zipline

*zipline* seems to work only with Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 and it's failing to install on my 3.8 environment.

According to this: https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/issues/2616 Quantopian merged with RonbinHood and I don't know whether zipline will continue to be developed or not.

For the reasons stated above I won't continue to try to install and develop the MA strategy with it.
