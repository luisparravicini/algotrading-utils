## ccxt

Here are some tests I've made using ccxt, everything here is a WIP.

Currently there's code to connect to an exchange, pull the ohlcv data periodically and save it to a SQLite3 database.


## Requeriments

Install the dependencies with:

```
pip install --user -r requeriments.txt
```

And the dev dependencies are listed in `requeriments-dev.txt`
